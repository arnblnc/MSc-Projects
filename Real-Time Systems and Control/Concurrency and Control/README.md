# Concurrency & Control Assignment

## Description
This repository contains a report on concurrent programming and control systems, focusing on synchronisation mechanisms, real-time task management, and mortgage loan modelling. The assignment is divided into two major sections:
1. Concurrency & Synchronisation – Examining semaphores, locks, pools, and channels in real-time systems.
2. Loan Modelling & Stability Analysis – Developing a difference equation model for mortgage payments and analysing system observability and stability.

## Project Highlights
### Concurrency & Synchronisation
- Forms of Concurrent Computation: Discusses multiprogramming, multiprocessing, and distributed processing.
- Semaphore-based Synchronisation: Implements semaphores to synchronise concurrent tasks accessing shared resources.
- Efficiency of Semaphores vs. Locks: Explains how semaphores improve efficiency by avoiding busy-waiting and enabling better resource control.
- Task Communication: Compares pools and channels as mechanisms for handling concurrent task interactions.
- Counting Semaphores in Real-time Systems: Provides pseudocode demonstrating how counting semaphores manage synchronisation between sensor-reading and actuator control tasks.
### Loan Modelling & Stability Analysis
- Linear Difference Equation for Mortgage Repayments: Models how loan balances evolve over time under fixed and proportional repayment policies.
- Observability in Dynamic Systems: Explains how to determine whether a system’s initial state can be inferred from its output.
- Stability Analysis of Mortgage Payments: Tests the stability of a closed-loop payment system, assessing whether mortgage balances remain manageable over time.
- Affordability Analysis: Evaluates whether a borrower’s repayment strategy is financially sustainable.
