# Sensors & Actuators: Ultrasonic Sensor Measurement Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a report on sensor selection, measurement, and analysis, focusing on the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module. The coursework involved designing an experiment, collecting measurement data, and performing statistical analysis to evaluate the sensor’s accuracy and precision.
### The project aimed to:
- Understand different sensor types and versions.
- Conduct hands-on measurements using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Apply statistical analysis to evaluate measurement accuracy.
- Improve technical writing and teamwork skills through a group report.

## Project Highlights
### Ultrasonic Sensor Measurement Analysis
- Sensor Selection & Experiment Design: The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor was chosen for distance measurement experiments.
- Arduino-based Measurement Setup: The sensor was interfaced with an Arduino Uno and programmed to record distance measurements.
- Measurement & Statistical Analysis:
  - 10 different distances were measured and compared with actual values.
  - Mean, variance, and least squares regression were used to assess accuracy.
  - Limitations due to temperature variations and environmental factors were identified.
- Circuit Schematic & Implementation: The Tinkercad schematic illustrates the circuit used for the experiment.

## Project Outcomes
- Reliability Assessment: The sensor proved reasonably accurate, but improvements could be made by collecting more data points.
- Future Work Recommendations: The addition of a temperature sensor could help improve accuracy by accounting for the effect of temperature on sound velocity.
