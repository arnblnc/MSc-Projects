# Comparative Analysis of Encoder Designs for Electric Vehicles

## Description
This repository contains a report comparing optical and magnetic encoders in electric vehicle (EV) applications. The study examines their accuracy, durability, environmental resistance, and impact on motor control, regenerative braking, and efficiency.

## Key Highlights
- Optical Encoders: High accuracy but sensitive to dust and temperature; used in steering and motor control.
- Magnetic Encoders: More durable, resistant to harsh environments, but lower resolution; ideal for drivetrains and braking systems.
- Error Analysis: Identifies misalignment, stray magnetic fields, and calibration issues affecting performance.
- Future Improvements: Suggests hybrid encoders, error correction techniques, and enhanced manufacturing for better performance.
