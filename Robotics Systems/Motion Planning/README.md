# Motion-Planning-Group-Project
Dedicated to optimising robotic movement, this repo covers RRT, PRM, and A* methodologies for motion planning. Explore collision-free paths, navigate obstacles, and delve into practical applications and analyses of each technique.

## Required Libraries
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## Description
This repository is dedicated to the study and implementation of motion planning, a computational domain focused on the optimisation of robotic movement. The primary objective is to devise collision-free paths from a starting point to a goal, navigating around various obstacles.

## Key Methodologies
- Randomized Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT): An exploration-based algorithm to determine a resolution for the path.
- Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM): A modification of the RRT approach, this method generates a roadmap of nodes and edges, leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm to plan the path.
- A Algorithm:* A search-based technique optimised for 2D environments, it identifies the shortest path using additional heuristics.

## Analysis
The repository offers a critical analysis comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each method, supplemented with case studies for practical demonstrations.
