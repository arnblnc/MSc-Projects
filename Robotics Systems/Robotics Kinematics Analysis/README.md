# Robotics Kinematics Analysis Group Project
## Description
This repository houses a comprehensive group report on the kinematics analysis of robotic systems. As the field of robotics continues to evolve and find applications across diverse industries, understanding the intricacies of robot movement and mechanics is essential.

## Report Highlights
- Frame Assignment & D-H Table Construction: Assigning frames to robot links and constructing the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) table.
- Kinematics Computation: Delving into forward and inverse kinematics, computing Jacobian matrices, and pinpointing singularities.
- Robot Simulation in MuJoCo: A detailed exploration of a robot's kinematics using the MuJoCo simulation environment.
The report not only provides a step-by-step explanation of each task, methodology, and results but also discusses the broader significance of kinematics analysis in real-world robotics applications.
